# Getting Started with the Mobile Friendly Music Studio App

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Most assets copied out of figma are located in the public folder we have exported css into src/styles/*.css.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run this before any other commands.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
